1.Explain what is a cluster and what is a Hadoop cluster:

· A cluster is a group of servers and other resources that act like a single system and enable high availability
  and, in some cases, load balancing and parallel processing. 
· A Hadoop cluster is a special type of computational cluster designed specifically for storing and analyzing 
  huge amounts of unstructured data in a distributed computing environment. 
  Such clusters run Hadoop's open source distributed processing software on low-cost commodity computers. 
  Typically one machine in the cluster is designated as the NameNode and another machine the as
  JobTracker; these are the masters. The rest of the machines in the cluster act as both DataNode and
  TaskTracker; these are the slaves. Hadoop clusters are often referred to as "shared nothing" systems
  because the only thing that is shared between nodes is the network that connects them. 
  Hadoop clusters are known for boosting the speed of data analysis applications. They also are highly
  scalable: If a cluster's processing power is overwhelmed by growing volumes of data, additional cluster 
  nodes can be added to increase throughput. Hadoop clusters also are highly resistant to failure because
  each piece of data is copied onto other cluster nodes, which ensures that the data is not lost if one 
  node fails.
 
2.What is meant by a Rack and explain the rack arrangement in a Hadoop cluster:

  A Node is simply a computer. This is typically non-enterprise, commodity hardware for nodes that contain data. 
  Storage of Nodes is called as rack. A rack is a collection of 30 or 40 nodes that are physically stored close
  together and are all connected to the same network switch. Network bandwidth between any two nodes in rack is
  greater than bandwidth between two nodes on different racks. A Hadoop Cluster is a collection of racks.
  Hadoop Cluster would consists of -:
· 110 different racks
· Each rack would have around 40 slave machine
· At the top of each rack there is a rack switch
· Each slave machine(rack server in a rack) has cables coming out it from both the ends
· Cables are connected to rack switch at the top which means that top rack switch will have around 80 ports
· There are global 8 core switches
· The rack switch has uplinks connected to core switches and hence connecting all other racks with uniform 
  bandwidth, forming the Cluster
· In the cluster, few machines to act as Name node and as JobTracker. They are referred as Masters. These masters
  have different configuration favoring more DRAM and CPU and less local storage.
· The majority of the machines acts as DataNode and Task Trackers and are referred as Slaves. These slave nodes
  have lots of local disk storage and moderate amounts of CPU and DRAM.
